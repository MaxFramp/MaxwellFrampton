							<h1>Projects</h1>
							<h2>The Launch Pad</h2>
							<p><em> August 2023 - November 2023</em> <br>
								In August of this year, I commenced my role with the 309th Software Engineering Group (SWEG). While awaiting security clearance, I have been contributing to the "Launch Pad" group, initially collaborating with the   Protection from Enemy Reconnaissance Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (PPER UAV) team. In this capacity, I developed a program facilitating communication between a LiDAR sensor and a Raspberry Pi, as well as initiated the creation of a custom Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) program for a drone, employing both C++ and Python. <a href="https://github.com/MaxFramp/SF40_LiDAR_python">Github Link.</a><br>
								Subsequently, I have transitioned to a new project, collaborating with a teammate to develop a .NET application simulating the 6 degree-of-freedom movement of a rigid body connected to various vibration isolators, sway dampeners, torsion bars, and foam bumpers. This project has allowed me to apply my knowledge of physics, dynamics, and linear algebra, with the end goal of creating a deliverable product for our customer. <br>
								In this short time, the diverse projects I have been privileged to be part of have been instrumental in my continuous learning and skill development. The experiences have not only broadened my technical expertise but have also ignited a passion for machine learning. I have actively pursued this interest, participating in a week-long bootcamp focused on enhancing my Python skills for data science, exploring libraries such as NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, and, notably, Scikit-learn. My goal is to integrate machine learning into my projects, and I am enthusiastic about the prospect of furthering my knowledge in this field in my graduate studies.

							<h2>Senior Project: Team Icarus Thermal Control System</h2>
							<p>
								<em>August 2022 - April 2023</em> <br>
								A pivotal educational experience was my senior project, where I was the chief financial officer for Team Icarus. Our team worked to develop a thermal control system that was compact enough to deploy as part of a CubeSat satellite. As the team’s CFO, I prepared and adhered to a budget encompassing all expenses related to the project's execution, ensuring fiscal responsibility and efficiency. Additionally, I created and maintained a Master Equipment List (MEL), a comprehensive database containing vital information for each component of the system. This senior project not only served as a practical application of my aerospace engineering education but also deepened my understanding of project management, budgeting, and effective communication in a collaborative setting. Despite various challenges and setbacks faced by the team, including the loss of one of our team members, we were able to work together and achieve success.
							</p>
							<h2>Computational Imaging and Smart Structures (CISS) Lab</h2>
							<p>
								<em>October 2021 - December 2022</em> <br>
								While at the University of Alabama, I had the opportunity to work as an undergraduate research assistant in Dr. Jiaze He's Computational Imaging and Smart Structures (CISS) lab. In this capacity, I supported Dr. He in groundbreaking research on ultrasonic imaging methods, exploring their applications in nondestructive testing and monitoring structural health. This experience exposed me to MATLAB, which I utilized for data collection, transformation, and preparation—skills that have proved invaluable as I transition into my professional career.
