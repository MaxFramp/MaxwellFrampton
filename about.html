							<p>
								Welcome to my online portfolio! This is a picture of my wife, India and I. We got married in September 2021, and she is my greatest motivator, the ideal coach, and my best friend! Let me tell you a little bit more about myself, how I got to where I am now, and where I hope to go in the future.
							</p>
							<p>
								I am originally from Clinton, Utah, where I lived until I moved to Tuscaloosa in 2017. In 2015, I began attending Weber State University, and when I was 16, I got my associate degree in general studies in 2017, the month before I graduated high school. I was not sure about where I was going and was not as focused and as motivated as I knew that I could be.
							</p>
							<p>
								In July 2018, I deferred enrollment for a time to serve a religious and humanitarian mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints in El Salvador and Belize, where I gained a valuable international perspective. I also learned how to work hard and the value of service, and how to deal with challenges to my physical and mental well-being. I also learned to speak Spanish fluently, which has been a great benefit to me. To this day, this remains one of the most valuable formative experiences of my life and has had a profound effect on every part of me. There I saw true poverty, and I felt the pure joy of forgetting myself and helping others.
							</p>
							<p>
								I returned home in March 2020 at the start of the pandemic, due to international travel restrictions. I met India that fall, and we got married in September 2021. I continued my studies and graduated cum laude from the University of Alabama in May 2023.
							</p>
							<p>
								I began working for the USAF in August 2023 as an aerospace engineer through the Palace Acquire internship program. So far it has been an immense learning experience, and I have developed a host of new technological skills. I am currently preparing for the next step in my career by attending graduate school to study computer science.
