							<h1>About Me</h1>
							<span class="image center"><img src="images/DSC03724.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>Welcome to my online portfolio! This is a picture of my wife, India and I. We got married in September 2021, and she is my greatest motivator, the ideal coach, and my best friend! Let me tell you a little bit more about myself, how I got to where I am now, and where I hope to go in the future.</p>
							<p>
								I am originally from Clinton, Utah, where I lived until I came to Tuscaloosa in 2017. I was always successful in school, but for a long time I lacked a strong direction in my life, especially regarding my future career. In 2015, I began attending Weber State University, and when I was 16, I got my associate degree in general studies in 2017, the month before I graduated high school. I was still not sure about where I was going and was not as focused and as motivated as I knew that I could be.</p>
							<p>Despite my uncertainty, I felt confident in the decision I made to attend the University of Alabama. To me, it represented a chance to get away from familiarity and figure out exactly who I wanted to be. I felt strongly about my decision to major in aerospace engineering as well. My first semester at UA was in the fall of 2017. I was fairly withdrawn socially, but I worked hard and earned good grades, although I remained somewhat undetermined on my vision for the long-term future.</p>
							<p>In July 2018, I left the United States for a time to serve a religious and humanitarian mission in El Salvador and Belize, where I gained a valuable international perspective. I also learned how to work hard and the value of service, and how to deal with challenges to my physical and mental well-being. I also learned to speak Spanish fluently, which has been a great benefit to me. To this day, this remains one of the most valuable formative experiences of my life and has had a profound effect on every part of me. There I saw true poverty, and I felt the pure joy of forgetting myself and helping others. </p>
							<p>I returned home in March 2020 at the start of the pandemic, due to international travel restrictions. I still was unsure about my path in life, but I applied to and later joined the STEM Path to MBA program, where I gained new knowledge and a much greater motivation in my studying. I also added a Spanish minor around that time, as I wanted to maintain the fluency that I achieved in El Salvador, as well as to broaden my Spanish knowledge to include a more academic and business-centered vocabulary. </p>
							<p>As I said above, I married India in September 2021. We met soon after I returned from El Salvador, and I knew immediately that she was special. As we dated and got to know each other, everything just made sense, and we decided to start our life together. She is the most amazing person I know, and she drives me to aim higher in everything that I do.
							</p>
							<p>Last year, I joined the Alabama Rocketry Association (ARA) as part of the Liquids team, where I am helping to develop a fully student-designed liquid-fueled rocket. It has been a great experience, and I have loved my time spent with the organization. In November 2021, I joined Dr. Jiaze He in the Computational Imaging and Smart Structures (CISS) lab as an undergraduate research assistant, supporting him in his research in ultrasonic imaging methods, and their applications in nondestructive testing and monitoring structural health.</p>
